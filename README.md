Concept
-------
Few years ago, i was a big outlook fan. Please, continue reading :). 
I liked the way i could hangle emails and tasks. The best function was to flag a message and set a duedate. 
So i don't have to copy text, go to tasks, or other task manager and paste is and so on.
I realized i don't like creating tasks. I wanted to getting things done. A client send me some issues, i marked it, when it was done i sent a reply.
It was quick and easy, but sometimes i lost in forwards and replies not to mention when there were 5 or more people on the project. 

**I've started to build this tool, to solve these problems:**
* No new email threads on the same project
* No missing recipients
* Endless attachment searching in emails
* Creating tasks, missing informations in tasks
* Difficult to managing deadlines, events
